# Project Title

Fruit Vegetable Recognition System

# Project Description

This project is about Fruits Vegetable classification. It is a simple web application that every user can use it. User need to upload the Image of any fruit or vegetable. This system will automatically classify the Image and it will give you the prediction about the name of fruit or vegetable, and calories of the predicted object. This is web application, so user can directly use it in any browser.




## Tools & Libraries

- Keras -> We are using for deep learning tasks like creating 
   model, predicting the object etc.

- Pillow -> Pillow we are using for preprocessing the images 
   of our dataset.

- Streamit -> It is backend framework for developing the web 
   application.

- Beautifulsoup, Requests -> We are using it for scraping the     calories from the internet for the predicted object.

- Numpy -> We are using it for the Image matrix handling.






## Deployment

Open cmd in the working directory and run


```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the project run

```bash
   streamlit run Fruits_Vegetable_Classification.py
```

and test it.
